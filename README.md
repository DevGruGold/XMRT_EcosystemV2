# XMRT Ecosystem V2

This repository contains the updated XMRT Ecosystem V2, a comprehensive suite of tools and applications designed to facilitate the development and deployment of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. This ecosystem aims to provide a robust and scalable foundation for blockchain-based projects, offering various components for different aspects of dApp development, from smart contract creation to frontend and mobile application development.

## Project Structure

The XMRT Ecosystem V2 is organized into several key directories, each serving a specific purpose:

- **`ai-agents/`**: Contains AI-powered agents designed to assist in various development tasks, such as smart contract generation and code analysis.
- **`apps/`**: Houses the different applications within the ecosystem, including web and mobile frontends.
  - **`apps/mobile/`**: Mobile application source code.
  - **`apps/web/`**: Web application source code.
- **`contracts/`**: Contains the smart contracts for the XMRT Ecosystem, including core functionalities, bridges, and governance mechanisms.
- **`docs/`**: Documentation files for the project, providing detailed information on setup, usage, and architecture.
- **`infrastructure/`**: Infrastructure-related files, such as Docker configurations for deployment.
- **`packages/`**: Reusable packages and modules shared across different parts of the ecosystem.
  - **`packages/ecosystem-archives/`**: Archived versions of various ecosystem components and related projects.
  - **`packages/shared/`**: Shared utility functions and components.
  - **`packages/ui/`**: UI components and design system.
